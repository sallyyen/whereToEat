# Custom App: Where To Eat #

## Description ##
In a nutshell, my application will help indecisive people choose where to eat. Users will be given several options such as cuisine, distance from current location, and price range. From those specifications, several food options will be provided. The screen will have a “wheel” of potential options that the user can spin to randomly choose which place to eat. Past places that the user went to will be kept track of in a “History” tab so that they may look back on places they’ve eaten.
